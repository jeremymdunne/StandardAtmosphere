This is a collection of functions intended to help access and determine standard atmosphere properties at a given altitude. 

This is accomplished through linear interpolation of the data found on https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-atmosphere-d_604.html 

Currently this does use linear interpolation, a multi-order approach would be more beneficial, and should be attempted in the future.
